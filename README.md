# Sam Clark

I'm a software engineer working at SmartThings in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

I'm working on media streaming services for IoT cameras, focusing on device-to-cloud stuff, none of which is on my public GitHub.
Most of the things here are side projects written in Rust, or testing grounds for shiny new (to me) tools.

I've got a little landing page at https://www.samhclark.com with links to a couple other things.
Feel free to check that out.
