# Sam Clark

I'm a software engineer working at Target in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

I do full stack work there (Android, JVM backend, Postgres, Mongo), none of which is on my public GitHub.
Most of the things here are side projects written in Rust, or testing grounds for shiny new (to me) tools.

I've got a little landing page at https://www.samhclark.com with links to a couple other things.
Feel free to check that out.
